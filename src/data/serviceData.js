      content: "Assessment and Diagnosis involves a more in-depth investigation of children and differentiates them from various developmental disorders. Lack of acquisition of the normal standardized milestones within known accepted and established ranges are considered abnormal and associated with a high probability of a developmental disability. In-depth diagnosis and evaluation are important in determining optimal interventional strategies based on the child’s profile of strengths and weaknesses. Assessment is done in a holistic approach on Behavioural, Emotional and Social Development parameters which consist of clinical, psychological and standard therapy assessments. The key to appropriate teaching lies in careful and ongoing assessment linked with teaching."

A small special child may be a joy to behold and easy to carry, but when that same child grows up and does not have ADL abilities it becomes a tremendous burden on a mother because she is older and the child is heavier NEURODIVERSE is the only centre in KASHMIR to offer ADL training to the special children ADL Training involves self-care, self-management and home management. Activities of daily living (ADL) are the basic daily activities one does to be independent."

        content: "Art Therapy is a psychological discipline that specializes in using visual art making and enhancing the inherent creative process to help children achieve their full potential and bring about therapeutic change. Art therapy is generally described as a highly illuminating, enjoyable, and unique experience. There is a commonly held belief that art making is beneficial to people (particularly children) with Autism Spectrum Disorder due to their intense sensory needs (especially visual and tactile self-stimulation) and disregulation, often nonverbal nature, and need for more visual, concrete, hands-on therapies. ASD therapists of all kinds acknowledge this and, despite lack of appropriate training, many attempt to include therapeutic art making into their child’s activities on a regular basis. Art therapy literature on the subject is large enough to demonstrate that it is an effective, clinically-sound treatment option (especially when supplemented with studies from the fields of art, art education, psychology, and other creative arts therapies)."
